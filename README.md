# Implement_SVM_to-classify_images_of_cats_dogs

**Cats vs Dogs Classification with SVM**

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

**Introduction**
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify images as either a cat or a dog. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for its robustness in binary classification tasks, making it suitable for this dataset.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle. It contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs, which are divided into a training set and a testing set.

Usage

**Data Preprocessing**
Download and extract the dataset from Kaggle.
Place the images in the data/train directory for training and data/test directory for testing.
Run the data preprocessing script to resize images and extract features.
Train the SVM Model
Run the training script to train the SVM model on the preprocessed data:

**Evaluate the Model**
Run the evaluation script to test the model's accuracy on the test data:

**Results**
The SVM model achieved high accuracy in classifying the images. Detailed results, including precision, recall, and F1 score.
